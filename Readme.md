This work aims to solve the problem of binary classification of tweets in order to determine
whether they contain propaganda. The initial data was a dataset published on the Kaggle
platform ("Twitter Propaganda Classification Dataset") containing labeled messages.
To complete the task, modern transformer models were selected and comparatively tested:
mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, mT5 and DeBERTa v3. 

imports: pip install pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, torch, numpy, transformers

You can run file "RUN_ALL.bat" to train all models on Windows.
Or run them one by one.
